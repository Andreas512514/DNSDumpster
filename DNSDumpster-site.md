# DNSDumpster

If we search DNSDumpster for tryhackme.com, we will discover the subdomain blog.tryhackme.com, which a typical DNS query cannot provide. In addition, DNSDumpster will return the collected DNS information in easy-to-read tables and a graph. DNSDumpster will also provide any collected information about listening servers.

DNSDumpster will also represent the collected information graphically. DNSDumpster displayed the data from the table earlier as a graph. You can see the DNS and MX branching to their respective servers and also showing the IP addresses.
